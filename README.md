 **What do results of these tests mean to me!**
 
 Gives me a fair introspection in my work and over all personality. Great indication as to where I can improve in my over all working    behavior.


**How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?**

My personality test indicates I am 48% agreeable. I guess that a reasonable percentage to work in a team. However I would like to move that upwards to atleast 70% so that the team can feel totally comfortable in sharing details and suggestions with me. 

**How should you take this into account when forming a team?**

I would make sure my teammates possess qualities which I I lack so we can have a balance in the team.
