 **What do results of these tests mean to me!**
 
 Gives me a fair introspection in my work and over all personality. Great indication as to where I can improve in my over all working    behavior.


**How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?**

My personality test indicates I am 48% agreeable. I guess that a reasonable percentage to work in a team. However I would like to move that upwards to atleast 70% so that the team can feel totally comfortable in sharing details and suggestions with me. 

**How should you take this into account when forming a team?**

I would make sure my teammates possess qualities which I I lack so we can have a balance in the team.

 
 ### Project Idea
 
 **OverView**
 
 Developing a mobile application, which will help people to make their own cricket teams by finding players and play matches with other teams by creating a tournament. 
 
 **Motivation**
 
 There are heaps of people of all ages who love the sport of cricket and want to play this sport. But because it’s team game, you don’t tend to find the right set of people to play with. So this application will help to find the like minded people who want to play and connect.
 
 **Description**
 
 Any person interested can register in the application by providing his age, suburb and what cricketing skills he has (Batting or bowling). Once he enters,  he will be connected to all the people with the same filters and they can form their team on the application. Similarly their will be many other teams which will be created. They can then organize and play tournaments. All the records, scores, grounds details will be available online. It will also prompt and give notifications to players before every match or practice session. The players can form chat rooms and discuss game plans, strategies etc.
 
 **Tools & Technologies**
 
 Android SDK / iOS, Java and HTML/CSS related technologies can be used.
 
 **Skills Required**
 
 Knowledge of Java, Android or iOS SDK along with HTML or CSS are the kind of skills required.
 
 **Outcome**
 
 With the kind of passion for cricket in Australia, I am confident that this application will be a definite icon on every cricket lovers phone. Need to strategize how this app will be marketed.
